        "description": "Strengthen your understanding of data structures and their algorithms for the foundation you need to successfully design, implement and maintain virtually any software system. Theoretical, yet practical, DATA STRUCUTRES AND ALGORITHMS IN C++, 4E by experienced author Adam Drosdek highlights the fundamental connection between data structures and their algorithms, giving equal weight to the practical implementation of data structures and the theoretical analysis of algorithms and their efficiency. This edition provides critical new coverage of treaps, k-d trees and k-d B-trees, generational garbage collection, and other advanced topics such as sorting methods and a new hashing technique. Abundant C++ code examples and a variety of case studies provide valuable insights into data structures implementation. DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS IN C++ provides the balance of theory and practice to prepare readers for a variety of applications in a modern, object-oriented paradigm.",

Data Structures and Algorithms in Python is the first mainstream object-oriented book available for the Python data structures course.  Designed to provide a comprehensive introduction to data structures and algorithms, including their design, analysis, and implementation, the text will maintain the same general structure as Data Structures and Algorithms in Java and Data Structures and Algorithms in C++.",

        "description": "This second edition of Data Structures and Algorithms in C++ is designed to provide an introduction to data structures and algorithms, including their design, analysis, and implementation. The authors offer an introduction to object-oriented design with C++ and design patterns, including the use of class inheritance and generic programming through class and function templates, and retain a consistent object-oriented viewpoint throughout the book.This is a “sister” book to Goodrich & Tamassia’s Data Structures and Algorithms in Java, but uses C++ as the basis language instead of Java. This C++ version retains the same pedagogical approach and general structure as the Java version so schools that teach data structures in both C++ and Java can share the same core syllabus. In terms of curricula based on the IEEE/ACM 2001 Computing Curriculum, this book is appropriate for use in the courses CS102 (I/O/B versions), CS103 (I/O/B versions), CS111 (A version), and CS112 (A/I/O/F/H versions).",

        "price": 89.10,
        "description": "Some books on algorithms are rigorous but incomplete; others cover masses of material but lack rigor. Introduction to Algorithms uniquely combines rigor and comprehensiveness. The book covers a broad range of algorithms in depth, yet makes their design and analysis accessible to all levels of readers. Each chapter is relatively self-contained and can be used as a unit of study. The algorithms are described in English and in a pseudocode designed to be readable by anyone who has done a little programming. The explanations have been kept elementary without sacrificing depth of coverage or mathematical rigor. The first edition became a widely used text in universities worldwide as well as the standard reference for professionals. The second edition featured new chapters on the role of algorithms, probabilistic analysis and randomized algorithms, and linear programming. The third edition has been revised and updated throughout. It includes two completely new chapters, on van Emde Boas trees and multithreaded algorithms, substantial additions to the chapter on recurrence (now called “Divide-and-Conquer”), and an appendix on matrices. It features improved treatment of dynamic programming and greedy algorithms and a new notion of edge-based flow in the material on flow networks. Many exercises and problems have been added for this edition. The international paperback edition is no longer available; the hardcover is available worldwide.",

        "description": "Fully updated for Java Platform, Standard Edition 11 (Java SE 11), Java: A Beginner’s Guide, Eighth Edition gets you started programming in Java right away. Best-selling programming author Herb Schildt begins with the basics, such as how to create, compile, and run a Java program. He then moves on to the keywords, syntax, and constructs that form the core of the Java language. The book also covers some of Java’s more advanced features, including multithreaded programming, generics, lambda expressions, modules, and Swing. As an added bonus, an introduction to JShell, Java’s interactive programming tool, is included. Best of all, it’s written in the clear, crisp, uncompromising style that has made Schildt the choice of millions worldwide.",

        "description": "A clear and student-friendly way to teach the fundamentals of C++ Starting Out with C++: From Control Structures through Objects covers control structures, functions, arrays, and pointers before objects and classes in Tony Gaddis’s hallmark accessible, step-by-step presentation. His books help beginning students understand the important details necessary to become skilled programmers at an introductory level. Gaddis motivates the study of both programming skills and the C++ programming language by presenting all the details needed to understand the “how” and the “why”–but never losing sight of the fact that most beginners struggle with this material. His approach is gradual and highly accessible, ensuring that students understand the logic behind developing high-quality programs.  As with all Gaddis texts, clear and easy-to-read code listings, concise and practical real-world examples, and an abundance of exercises appear in every chapter. Updates to the 9th Edition include revised, improved problems throughout and a new chapter featuring completely rewritten and expanded material on the Standard Template Library (STL).",
